lyrics:
    Walking in the dark, tonight 

    Nowhere but inside, a light

    Guide me through the night

    through the path back to you

    The silence of your voice in my heart.


    But now I know you're holding my hand

    'Cause all I want, is you by my side

    When I’m with you all my fears fall apart


    YOU ARE THE

    ONE THAT GAVE ME ALL MY

    LIFE IS NOW

    ALL I HAVE AND ALL I WANT

    ALL I AM, WHERE I BELONG

    I WANNA GIVE MY ALL

    GIVE MY ALL OF ME

    I’M COMING HOME

    ALL MY LIFE


    Laughter fills the air, fills my head
    
    (flying in my head)

    Everlasting bonds, will never break
    
    (follow your)

    Footprints in the sand

    lead back home, back to you.

    Singing with your life, with your love


    But now I know you're holding my hand

    'Cause all I want, is you by my side

    When I’m with you all my fears fall apart


    YOU ARE THE

    ONE THAT GAVE ME ALL MY

    LIFE IS NOW

    ALL I HAVE AND ALL I WANT

    ALL I AM, WHERE I BELONG

    I WANNA GIVE MY ALL

    GIVE MY ALL OF ME

    I’M COMING HOME

    ALL MY LIFE


    Where I belong, is all I want,

    Coming back home, uh uh uh

    Is all I want, uh uh uh
